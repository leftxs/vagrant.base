Custom Settings
===============

Change default settings with a *custom* settings.yml

Currently supported settings are Hostname [dnsmane], Memory [mem] and CPU [cpu]

Here is how a example *settings.yml* could look like

.. code-block :: bash
    ---
    dnsname: examle.io
    mem: 1
    cpu: 2

This will setup a mashine with the hostname: example.io, with 1 Gig of memory and 2 CPU's
